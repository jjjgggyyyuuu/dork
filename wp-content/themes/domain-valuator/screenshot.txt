This file is a placeholder for the screenshot.png that should be created.

A proper WordPress theme should have a screenshot.png file in the theme's root directory with the following specifications:
- Dimensions: 1200px x 900px
- Format: PNG
- The screenshot should represent the theme's appearance

Please replace this text file with an actual PNG image of the theme.
